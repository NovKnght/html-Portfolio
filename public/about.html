<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Von Ellis and I want to become a software engineer I graduated high school year of 2020 
  Started going to CCAC. Also, I started working at UPMC as a housekeeper to pay for my college.
  I’ve been coding on and off for about a couple years. I’ve been taking it more seriously I bought some Boot-camp on Udemy and I’ve been trying to work through them. 
  I’ve been doing free code camp working my way through that slow process of building my own website..</p>

<p>My long-term goal is to become a back end developer 
  My short-term goal is to get in  the tech industry and learn as much as I can, and gain as much experience as possible and continue to improve my skills 
  .</p>

<p>This is my first website I have done so far and I hope to continue making more.</p>
